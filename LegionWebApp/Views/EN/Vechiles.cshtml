    <h4>Vehicles for the Armed Forces of Ukraine</h4>
    <p>Currently, the demand for military transport far exceeds the capability of state support.</p>
    <p>The army needs vehicles to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>increase the mobility of troops</li>
        <li>improve the material and technical capabilities of units</li>
        <li>save the lives of soldiers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The army needs diesel pickups, SUVs, minibuses, and other all-terrain vehicles. This fund will use your donations on the necessary transport for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.</p>
